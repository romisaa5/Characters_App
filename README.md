**characters_app** is a simple Flutter application that showcases character details. This project is part of my learning journey, where I apply **state management** concepts using **Bloc & Cubit**.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Flutter**
- **Dart**
- **Flutter Bloc (Cubit & Bloc)**

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Understand how to **separate business logic from UI**.
- Manage **different application states** using **Bloc & Cubit**.
- Implement **efficient state management** in a real-world app.

## 🛠 Features
- Display a list of characters with their images and details.
- Use **Cubit** to fetch and display data.
- Implement **Bloc** to handle different states like **loading, success, and failure**.
